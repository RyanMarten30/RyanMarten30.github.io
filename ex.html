                My name is Ryan Marten, I decided to grow my knowledge about software development. I started programming
                on my own, searching the web for all the problems I walked in to. Because of it I learned alot about the fundamentals
                of programming. My journey started with HTML and CSS and later on I did a online cursus about Python. This was where I really
                started to get more advanced in coding and made some fun projects. I struggled at first with OOP, after a while I figured it out
                , because of that I decided to follow a full time study about software development. It makes it easier now
                to understand more difficult problems, because there is always someone who can help you to figure out your problem.
